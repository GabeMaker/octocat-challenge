A branch is an independent line of development in a project.
A new branch can be created to work on new features without changing the 'master' (original) branch.
Any commits made while on a branch are logged separely to those on the master.
A branch can be 'merged' into another when there is no need to keep the work separate (e.g. when it is tested, clean and ready).
