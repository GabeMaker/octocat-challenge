git clone [GitHub repo URL]

example: git clone https://github.com/GabeMaker/octocat-challenge.git

This command:
- creates a new directory in the current working directory called "octocat-challenge" (and changes into it)
- runs the 'git init' command
- runs 'git remote add origin https://github.com/GabeMaker/octocat-challenge.git'
- runs 'git pull'

This has the effect of creating a local repo that is linked (by push and pull) to the cloned repo.
